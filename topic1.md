# Documentation Process in Agile

This article provides a time-tested documentation process that you can follow in agile. Are you a technical writer working in an agile environment? Then read on.
Documentation in agile means that writers are involved in the project right from the initial stage, which brings an excellent opportunity for writers to contribute towards user experience. 

Are you wondering how that is possible? As a writer, you are the first end-user of the application and better positioned to understand the user's needs. When the team (Dev, QA, Product Owner, Doc) read the requirements to understand the functionality, you can voice your suggestions towards usability improvements, meaningful UI labels, and error/warning messages. Since it is the initial stage of the process, your inputs will get considered.

Working in agile makes the entire team (Dev, QA, PO, Doc) work efficiently towards the same goal, delivering a working product with good user experience.
