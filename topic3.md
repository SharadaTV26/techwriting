## High Level Process Flow

- **Release Planning:** In this phase, the Leads analyzed the tickets (stories/epics) and created high-level estimates before assigning tickets to the team. Writers created task tickets in the Ticket Tracking System (Jira/Trac/etc.).

- **Research and Analysis:** We decided on the content development approach in this phase and gathered information based on SRS calls and clarification/discussion calls. During these meetings, we also suggested UI improvements.

We dived deep into the new feature to find out its working and business relevance. After gathering information, we performed user and task analysis for the new feature and created a high-level TOC.

- **Develop Content:** When developing content, we used Information Mapping to categorize the information into concepts, tasks, processes, etc. We also added graphics, flow diagrams, depending on how we wanted to present the information. 

- **Self-review/Verify Content:** It is always a best practice to proofread content. We maintained a comprehensive writer's checklist, which helped us correct the errors related to language, voice, style, grammar, consistency, etc.

By this phase, the new feature was available in the test application instance. We tested content flow in the application, made corrections (if any), and helped identify bugs in the application. ðŸ˜‰

- **Send for Review:** Getting the content reviewed by DEV/QA/PO was important for us. We sent updated content for reviews during QA testing phase. As a process, the team expected the content during this time, especially the QA, as they verified the task flow against the application. 

The process allowed the reviewers to complete the review before the sprint end and ensured that we worked in tandem with the cross-functional teams.

We enabled the Collaborative Review option in PDF when sending the review content, which helped us receive simultaneous reviews from all the reviewers.

- **Revise Content:** In this phase, we incorporated the received comments. There can be situations in agile when a feature may be put on hold for future release. In such cases, version control helped us to maintain the removed content intact for future reuse.

- **Publish and Deliver:** By now, the guide contained the finalized content from each writer. The guides were published and delivered based on the required delivery format (PDF, Web help). 

Usually, Leads were responsible for generating the final delivery format and placing it on the delivery platform (Help Portal, Application Help, etc.). As part of the delivery task, the writers checked their content in the application online help before the sprint release. 

This documentation process helped us be part of the R&D team right from the planning to release and made the documentation team an integral part of the entire agile process.
